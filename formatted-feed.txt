Content: What are the benefits for representing a package as a DID? I would expect a DID to represent an identity who can publish a package, and so can own many. This is how lexicons on atproto work too

Content: if you define that as part of core functionality; and say that the number of administrative domains scales linearly with number of accounts (eg, self-hosting model), then you get quadratic, both with activitypub and atproto.
