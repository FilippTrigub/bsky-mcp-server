# Bluesky MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and provides tools to interact with the ATProtocol.

You can use this MCP server to bring context from various Bluesky / ATProtocol API endpoints directly into the context window of your LLM based application. For example, you can add this server to Claude Desktop and then use it as a natural language Bluesky client. 

## Features & Tools

- Interact with common Bluesky features via natural language (e.g. "Get recent posts from David Roberts")
- Fetch and and analyze feeds ("Find me a feed about Seattle and tell me what people are talking about")
- Fetch and analyze lists of followers ("What types of accounts does Mark Cuban follow? Give me a detailed report")
- Use an LLM to write a post and then post it for you ðŸ˜± ("Write a haiku about today's weather in my area and post it to bluesky")
- Search for feeds, posts, and people ("Find posts about the #teslatakedown and give me a summary of revent events")

## Installation

First clone this repo, then install dependencies and build the server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm run build
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

You can test the bluesky tools directly without connecting to an LLM via the amazing [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector). First make sure you have built the server and then run:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/src/index.js
```

Navigate to the local URL provided in your terminal, and then set your BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER, BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD, and BLUESKY_SERVICE_URL environment variables from the panel on the left. Try the get-timeline tool to see the most revent posts from your home timeline. 

## MCP Client Configuration 

Follow the steps to set up MCP with your client of choice. For example, to set up Claude for desktop to connect to Bluesky, add the following to bluesky section to your claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "bluesky": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["/path/to/bsky-mcp-server/build/src/index.js"],
        "env": {
            "BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER": "your-bluesky-handle",
            "BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password",
            "BLUESKY_SERVICE_URL": "https://bsky.social"
          }
      }
    }
  }
```
